## Usage

Install this colour scheme using your preferred method, then place the
following lines in your Vim configuration.

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme raider
```

**Note**: Raider.vim is a true-colour Vim theme.  Make sure your terminal
emulator has true/24-bit colour support so that the colours match the
screenshot above.

[`contrib` branch](https://github.com/axvr/raider.vim/blob/contrib/emacs/raider-theme.el).
