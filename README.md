_The font in the above screenshot is [Inconsolata](https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) created by [Raph Levien](https://levien.com/)._


## Usage

Install this colour scheme using your preferred method, then place the
following lines in your Vim configuration.

```vim
set termguicolors
colorscheme raider
```

> **Note** Raider.vim is a true-colour Vim theme.  If your terminal emulator
> does not support true/24-bit colours, the colours won't match those in the
> above screenshot.


## Ports

An incomplete GNU Emacs port can be found on the
[`contrib` branch](https://github.com/axvr/raider.vim/blob/contrib/emacs/raider-theme.el).
