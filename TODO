- Light theme?

- Experiment with different colours.
  - Use the blue for something other than strings?
    - Strings are too bright when used as doc-strings.

- Update colours.clj to use CIELAB.
  - Also accept set of sRGB colours rather than a map.
  - Add a CLI interface.
  - Re-generate xterm-256 fallback colours.
